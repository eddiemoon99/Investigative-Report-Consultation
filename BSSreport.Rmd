# Technical report

## Introduction

This report will attempt to answer the research questions at hand about Black Saber Software. 

### Research questions

1. Are there any existing biases in regards to salaries of the current employees?

2. Does the new AI hiring system have any built-in biases? Does it favour a specific gender over the other?

3. Are there any other biases in the company in general?


## Current Employee Salaries

_For each research question, you will want to briefly describe any data manipulation, show some exploratory plots/summary tables, report on any methods you use (i.e. models you fit) and the conclusions you draw from these_

First we can begin by looking at our original dataset, and we will remove the entries where gender is "Prefer not to say". This is because we are trying to find biases that may exist in the gender, so we are not interested in the cases where it is not specified.
We also want to work with the salary, so we want the value to be numeric so we need to remove the dollar sign and comma from the values in that column.

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

## read in data
black_saber_current <- read_csv("data/black-saber-current-employees.csv")

## remove gender not specified
black_saber_current <- black_saber_current %>%
  filter(gender != "Prefer not to say")

## make the salary numeric
black_saber_current$salary = as.numeric(gsub("[\\$,]", "", black_saber_current$salary))

```

Now let's take a look at a basic scatterplot of our data as salary as the reponse variable.

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

## basic scatterplot

black_saber_current_plot <- black_saber_current %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=productivity, y=salary, colour=factor(gender))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(caption = "Figure 1. Productivity vs Salary scatterplot categoried by Gender",
       x = "Productivity", 
       y = "Salary") +
  theme(
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0)
  )
 
black_saber_current_plot + scale_colour_manual(name="Gender", values = c("#fc8c03", "#03fc7b"))

```

We can see that the salary ranges vary, but it seems they are generally categorized into three different levels, so we can create a new variable that states the salary level, Low, Medium, or High.
We can also see that productivity seems to vary greatly for all levels of salary, there are people from the productivity scale spread out fairly evenly.

Now let's look at some tables with proportions based on gender.

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

## add a new column for high, medium, and low salaries
black_saber_current <- black_saber_current %>%
  mutate(salary_type = case_when(
    (salary >= 140000) ~ "High",
    (salary >= 100000) ~ "Medium",
    (salary >= 0) ~ "Low"))

## table for men and women counts

table_1 <- table(black_saber_current$gender)
kable(table_1, caption = "Counts of gender")


## table for proportion based on salary type
table_2 <- table(black_saber_current$gender, black_saber_current$salary_type)
kable(prop.table(table_2, margin=1), caption ="Conditional proportions of salaries for each gender", digits = 3)

```

We can see from Table 2 that for both Man and Woman, the proportions are almost identical, meaning there are similar proportions of salary levels for both of the men and women.
This is one indicator that there is no bias based on gender for this specific case.


```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# This chunk provides an example of some things you can do with RMarkdown to make your report creation process easier

# read in the data
black_saber_current_employees <- read_csv("data/black-saber-current-employees.csv")
black_saber_phase1 <- read_csv("data/phase1-new-grad-applicants-2020.csv")
black_saber_phase2 <- read_csv("data/phase2-new-grad-applicants-2020.csv")
black_saber_phase3 <- read_csv("data/phase3-new-grad-applicants-2020.csv")
black_saber_finalhires <- read_csv("data/final-hires-newgrad_2020.csv")

# create a visualisation
my_plot <- black_saber_current_employees %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = productivity)) +
  geom_histogram(colour = "grey", fill = "#6C3082") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Look! A title. But do you want a title or a caption for your report?", x = "This is a changed x label")

# save your plot in your images folder, you can specify the height and width, too
# saving this means you can add the image to your exectuve summary without having to run or rerun the code, if you wish
ggsave("images/example.png", width = 7, height = 4)

# norice how the image is included with the ![](file/path.png) below
```

## Hiring AI

Again, we can remove the cases where gender is "Prefer not to say". Firstly we can look at the phase 1 data, the initial applicants. We will create a new variable called total_score, which is the sum of all the numeric variables in the phase 1 data. This wil give us an easy way to compare different applicants. The higher the total_score means the more value an applicant should have in very general terms.

Then we can create another column passed_round that takes TRUE if they made it to phase 2, or FALSE if they were not selected by the AI for phase 2. 

Finally, we can create a plot with the whether they passed or not as the response, and their score on the x-axis.

Let's separate our two graphs for each gender in our data, so we can easily visualize the comparisons.

``` {r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

## filtering out non-specified gender rows
black_saber_phase1 <- black_saber_phase1 %>%
  filter(gender != "Prefer not to say")

black_saber_phase2 <- black_saber_phase2 %>%
  filter(gender != "Prefer not to say")

black_saber_phase1 <- black_saber_phase1 %>%
  mutate(total_score = cover_letter + cv + gpa + extracurriculars + work_experience)


## checking whether they passed this phase
black_saber_new <- black_saber_phase1  %>%
  left_join(black_saber_phase2) %>%
  mutate(passed_round = case_when(
    (is.na(technical_skills) == FALSE) ~ TRUE,
     (is.na(technical_skills) == TRUE) ~ FALSE))

## plotting men vs women graphs
black_saber_new <- black_saber_new %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=total_score, y=passed_round, colour=factor(gender))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~gender) +
  labs(caption = "Figure 2. Applicant score vs. Success (TRUE for passing to phase two, FALSE for not)",
       x = "Score", 
       y = "Success") +
  theme(
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0)
  )

black_saber_new + scale_colour_manual(name="Gender", values = c("#fc8c03", "#03fc7b"))


```
We can see fairly clearly that the distributions for men vs women are similar. No applicant with a total score lower than ~ 6 passed the first stage. There does not seem to be any obvious biases here.
Let's follow the same approach for phase two to three. We will use the newly tested variables from phase two to create a new score, and again compare men vs women to see who passed. 

``` {r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

## make new score
black_saber_phase2 <- black_saber_phase2 %>%
  mutate(phase2_score = technical_skills + writing_skills + speaking_skills + leadership_presence)

## check if they passed
black_saber_new2 <- black_saber_phase2  %>%
  left_join(black_saber_phase3) %>%
  mutate(phase2_pass = case_when(
    (is.na(interviewer_rating_1) == FALSE) ~ TRUE,
     (is.na(interviewer_rating_1) == TRUE) ~ FALSE)) 

##plotting
## plotting men vs women graphs
black_saber_new2 <- black_saber_new2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=phase2_score, y=phase2_pass, colour=factor(gender))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~gender) +
  labs(caption = "Figure 3. (Phase 2->3) Applicant score vs. Success (TRUE for passing to phase two, FALSE for not)",
       x = "Score", 
       y = "Success") +
  theme(
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0)
  )

black_saber_new2 + scale_colour_manual(name="Gender", values = c("#fc8c03", "#03fc7b"))

```

## Discussion

_In this section you will summarize your findings across all the research questions and discuss the strengths and limitations of your work. It doesn't have to be long, but keep in mind that often people will just skim the intro and the discussion of a document like this, so make sure it is useful as a semi-standalone section (doesn't have to be completely standalone like the executive summary)._

## Code of ethical conduct

_This section should be fairly short, no more than half a page. Assume a general audience, much like your executive summary._

* _Make at least three relevant statements about your company’s approach to ethical statistical consulting. These should be appropriately in line with professional conduct advice like the (Statistical Society of Canada Code of Conduct)[https://ssc.ca/sites/default/files/data/Members/public/Accreditation/ethics_e.pdf] or the (Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice from the American Statistical Society)[https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx]. For example, "the customer is always right" ISN’T the type of thing an ethical statistical consultant would include._
*	_Be very careful not to just copy and paste from these other documents! Put things in your own words._
